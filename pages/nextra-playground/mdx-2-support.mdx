## MDX 2.0

Migration to [MDX 2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2) comes with improved performance, supporting any JSX runtime and JavaScript expression inside your markdown pages.

The following code:

```jsx
import Hero from "../../components/hero"
 
<Hero/>
 
Current year - {new Date().getFullYear()}

üßë‚Äçüíª JavaScript expressions {2 * Math.PI}
```

Looks like:

___
import Hero from "../../components/hero"
 
<Hero/>
 
Current year - {new Date().getFullYear()}

üßë‚Äçüíª JavaScript expressions {2 * Math.PI} 

___

and the following code:

```jsx
import {Chart} from '../../components/snowfall.jsx'
export const year = 2023

### Last year‚Äôs snowfall

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
```

Is converted into:

import {Chart} from '../../components/snowfall.jsx'
export const year = 2023

### Last year‚Äôs snowfall

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />

## Markdown Import

The following mdx code:

```mdx
import TaskList from '../includes/task-list.mdx'
 
<TaskList />
```

Inserts the markdowm file in `'../includes/task-list.mdx'` into the page:

import TaskList from '../includes/task-list.mdx'
 
<TaskList />

## Youtube component

```jsx
import Youtube from '../../components/youtube';

<Youtube id="a_2vXCeW21I" title="Arggg" />
