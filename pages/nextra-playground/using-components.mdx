# Using Components in mdx

You can find the code for the components used as examples in this chapter at file [ULL-ESIT-PL-2324/pl-nextra/tree/main/components](https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-PL-2324/pl-nextra/tree/main/components)

## Counter Component internal to the mdx file

This is the actual code inserted in the mdx file:

```js
import { useState } from 'react'

{/* Import CSS modules */}
import styles from '../..//components/counters.module.css'

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} className={styles.counter}>Clicked {count} times</button>
    </div>
  );
};

<Counter/>
```

And this the result:

import { useState } from 'react'

{/* Import CSS modules */}
import styles from '../..//components/counters.module.css'

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} className={styles.counter}>Clicked {count} times</button>
    </div>
  );
};

<Counter/>

## External Counter Component

This is the actual code:

```js
import Counters from '../../components/counters'

<Counters />
```

We import the component from `../../components/counters` and insert it in the mdx file.
This is the result:

<Callout>
import Counters from '../../components/counters'

<Counters />
</Callout>

## Hero component example

Migration to [MDX 2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2) comes with improved performance, supporting any JSX runtime and JavaScript expression inside your markdown pages.

The following code:

```jsx
import Hero from "../../components/hero"
 
<Hero/>
```

Looks like:

<Callout>
import Hero from "../../components/hero"
 
<Hero/>

</Callout>

## Youtube component

```jsx
import Youtube from '../../components/youtube';

<Youtube id="a_2vXCeW21I" title="Arggg" />
```

import Youtube from '../../components/youtube';

<Youtube id="a_2vXCeW21I" title="Arggg" />

## Snowfall component example

The following code:

```jsx
import {Chart} from '../../components/snowfall.jsx'
export const year = 2023

### Last year’s snowfall

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
```

Is converted into:

import {Chart} from '../../components/snowfall.jsx'
export const year = 2023

### Last year’s snowfall

In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
It was followed by a warm spring which caused
flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

<Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
