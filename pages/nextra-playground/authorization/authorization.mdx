# Authorization in Nextra

Search in  nextra/discussions forum for `authentication`:

* [nextra/discussions: authentication](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+authentication)

the discussion [Authentication for Nextra Doc Theme #2446](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions/2446) has some tip:


```js
/*
 * This file is responsbile for all the auth magic for the documentation.
 * It ensures that the user has a session before we show them anything on the page.
 *
 * This is all done server-side.
 *
 * Useful links:
 * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware
 * @see https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#basic-usage

import { withAuth } from 'next-auth/middleware';

export default withAuth({
    callbacks: {
        authorized({ token }) {
            // If we are in dev mode, don't require auth.
            if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') return true;

            // If there is a session token, allow login
            if (token) return true;

            // By default, don't allow login.
            return false;
        },
    },

### next-auth and Auth.js

The npm module [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) is used to implement authentication in Next.js and its docs can be found at [https://authjs.dev/](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/introduction). It seems they are changing their name to [Auth.js](https://x.com/balazsorban44/status/1603082914362986496?s=20)

The [OAuth tutorial](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/oauth-tutorial) teaches how setting Auth.js in a web application to be able to log in with GitHub. 

Here [are my notes about the tutorial](/nextra-playground/next-auth-tutorial)

### NODE_ENV

`NODE_ENV` is an environment variable made popular by the express web server framework. When a node application is run, it can check the value of the environment variable and do different things based on the value. `NODE_ENV` specifically is used (by convention) to state whether a particular environment is a production or a development environment. A common use-case is running additional debugging or logging code if running in a development environment.

```
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev
```
