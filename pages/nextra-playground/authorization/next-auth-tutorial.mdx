# Auth.js tutorial for Next.js with GitHub

These are my random notes about the tutorial [OAuth tutorial](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/oauth-tutorial) that teaches how setting Auth.js in a web application to be able to log in with GitHub.

## 1. Configuring Auth.js

To add Auth.js to your project:

### Installing NextAuth.js

```bash npm2yarn
npm install next-auth
```

### Creating the server config

Create the following [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes#catch-all-api-routes) file. This route contains the necessary configuration for NextAuth.js, as well as the dynamic route handler:

```js file="pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
})
```

<Callout type="info">

Behind the scenes, this creates all the relevant OAuth API routes within `/api/auth/*` so that auth API requests to:

- [GET `/api/auth/signin`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthsignin)
- [POST `/api/auth/signin/:provider`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#post--apiauthsigninprovider)
- [GET/POST `/api/auth/callback/:provider`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--post--apiauthcallbackprovider)
- [GET `/api/auth/signout`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthsignout)
- [POST `/api/auth/signout`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#post--apiauthsignout)
- [GET `/api/auth/session`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthsession)
- [GET `/api/auth/csrf`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthcsrf)
  - **[CSRF](/nextra-playground/authorization/csrf)** stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is a type of security threat in web applications. It's not directly a part of authorization mechanisms but rather a vulnerability that can occur when proper authorization controls are not in place or are circumvented. 
- [GET `/api/auth/providers`](https://authjs.dev/reference/rest-api#get--apiauthproviders)

can be handled by NextAuth.js. In this way, NextAuth.js stays in charge of the whole application's authentication request/response flow.

NextAuth.js is fully customizable - [our guides section](/guides) teaches you how to set it up to handle auth in different ways. All the possible configuration options are [listed here](/reference/core#authconfig).
